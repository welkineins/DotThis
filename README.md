DotThis
=======

A sublime plugin that replace "this." to "this->" for C++

This is a good but small feature in Qt Creator. When you type "this.",
it'll replace the dot with "->" and show up the autocomlete window. It save time!

Note: I'm a Python beginner and this my first to write a Sublime plugin. So ... Don't care the pool quility, and welcome for pull request :)
